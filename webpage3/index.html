    <h1>The origins of the rivalry</h1>

  </div> 
 
    <div class="paragraph1">
      <p>Prussia and Austria both became powerful states in a big group of German lands called the Holy Roman Empire. This group lasted for a long time, from the 900s to the 1800s. Prussia started as a small land under Poland, but it broke free and grew bigger under a family called the Hohenzollerns. Austria was the main land of a family called the Habsburgs, who ruled over many other lands like Bohemia, Hungary, Spain, and Italy. Prussia and Austria did not get along well, because they had different ideas about politics, religion, and money.

    <h1>The Silesian Wars</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph2">
    <p>The first major conflict between Prussia and Austria was over the province of Silesia, a rich and populous region in Bohemia that belonged to the Habsburgs. In 1740, Frederick II of Prussia, also known as Frederick the Great, invaded Silesia and claimed it as his own. This sparked the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748), a European-wide war that involved France, Britain, Spain, Russia, and other powers. Prussia managed to keep Silesia after defeating Austria in three battles: Mollwitz (1741), Chotusitz (1742), and Hohenfriedberg (1745). The war ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), which recognized Prussia’s sovereignty over Silesia</p>

   <h1>The Seven Years' War</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="paragraph3">
   <p>The second major conflict between Prussia and Austria was part of a global war that lasted from 1756 to 1763. Austria wanted to regain Silesia from Prussia, and formed an alliance with France, Russia, Sweden, and Saxony. Prussia was supported by Britain, Hanover, and some smaller German states. The war was fought on several fronts: Europe, North America, India, and the Caribbean. Prussia faced overwhelming odds against its enemies, but Frederick the Great managed to survive through his military genius and diplomatic skills. He won several decisive battles, such as Rossbach (1757), Leuthen (1757), Zorndorf (1758), and Torgau (1760). The war ended with the Treaty of Hubertusburg (1763), which confirmed Prussia’s possession of Silesia and its status as a great power in Europe</p>

    <h1>The Austro-Prussian War</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph4">
    <p>The third and final conflict between Prussia and Austria was also known as the Seven Weeks’ War or the German War. It took place in 1866 and was part of the process of German unification. Prussia and Austria had been allies in the German Confederation, a loose association of German states created after the Napoleonic Wars. However, they had different visions for the future of Germany: Prussia wanted a strong federal state under its leadership, while Austria wanted a loose confederation that preserved its influence. The war was triggered by a dispute over the administration of Schleswig-Holstein, two duchies that had been conquered from Denmark in 1864. Prussia allied with Italy, while Austria allied with most of the other German states. The war was short but decisive: Prussia defeated Austria in several battles, such as Königgrätz (1866), also known as Sadowa or Sadová. The war ended with the Treaty of Prague (1866), which excluded Austria from Germany and created the North German Confederation under Prussian dominance.</p>
